I love this recipe, because it's so simple to make.

Often times, I will skip the microwave stage, and just eat the brownie mix. There no egg in it, so it's not even a salmonella risk!

What you need
=============

* 1/4 cup sugar
* 1/4 cup flour
* 2 tbsp cocoa
* A pinch of salt
* 2 tbsp olive oil
* 3 tbsp water

Topping
* 5 tablespoon unsalted butter
* 5 tablespoon unsweetened cocoa powder
* 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
* 2 tablespoon milk
* 1Â½ cups confectioners' sugar

Steps
=====

1. Add all the dry ingredients to a mug.
2. Add the oil and water.
3. Mix until everything is mixed together well.
4. Microwave for 1 minute 40 seconds.

Topping:
1. In a large heatproof bowl, microwave the butter and cocoa powder until butter is melted. Beat together with a hand mixer until smooth. Add the vanilla and milk and stir.
2. Add the confectioners' sugar and stir, slowly at first, until incorporated; then beat on medium speed until frosting is smooth and creamy, about 1 minute. use immediately on cooled brownies, or store, covered at room temperature, for up to a day.
